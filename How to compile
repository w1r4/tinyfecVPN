Compile TinyFecvpn

A very good tool, the only bug is that the double-ended IP can only .1 and .2 officially did not give the compilation method To be reasonable is really egg pain, tidy up.

First clone down, to --recursive, because this project contains a subproject, direct clone will cause the submodule to be incomplete and unable to compile

git clone --recursive https://github.com/wangyu-/tinyfecVPN.git
Note edit the two-ended IP address information in the tun_dev_server and tun_dev_clinet:
line 219 and line 247, respectively:

assert(set_tun(tun_dev,htonl((ntohl(sub_net_uint32)&0xFFFFFF00)|130),htonl((ntohl(sub_net_uint32)&0xFFFFFF00 )|129),tun_mtu)==0);
Change 130 and 129 to the address you want

Then prepare to install the compilation tool, otherwise an error will be reported

yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' -y

yum install glibc-static libstdc++-static libxtst-dev -y
Compile when you're done

make nolimit -j $(grep "cpu cores" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
Compile and optimize

strip tinyvpn
